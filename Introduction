This course and its contents are a part of my notes taken while going through the book "Core Python Programming" by R.Nageshwara.Rao.
It covers the entire portion of exception handling which is a primary knowledge these days for SDEs or competitive programmers who want their code to be flaw-less.
The course will be out in form of various parts which will cover the following :
Concept of Bugs and the De-bugging
Common Types of Exceptions, definitions and examples
Exception handling with the except block
Exception handling with the assert block
User-defined exceptions
Exception-logging
Summary

The agenda of this course is to make you familiar with the concept of Exception via layman language and examples so that you can get more acquainted with python.
I sincerely hope that you will enjoy and learn something out of it.
