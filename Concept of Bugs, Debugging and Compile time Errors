# Mostly the errors in programs are defined as bugs while, the process of removing them is called De-bugging.
# Primarily errors are classified into 3 types - Compile time, Run time and Logical errors.

""" Compile time errors can be defined as those errors which rise as a result of syntactical mistakes commited while writting
code, it can occur due to a missing colon, comma, etc. in blocks of if, while, for, def, etc. keywords. Usually, the python
compiler detects these errors while execution and prints out a suitable message in the terminal along with the description of
the error. """

# An example of compile time error
k = 1
if k == 1
    print("The statement is true")
    
# The compiler prints out the message invalid syntax and hence, it is a compile time error
