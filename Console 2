"""" When the pvm(python virtual machine) can't execute the byte-code, it shows run-time error. It can occur when there is
in-sufficient memory to store something or the inability of the pvm to execute some statements come under run-time errors. The
main crux for these type of errors is that the python compiler is unable to detect these errors and they, can be detected by the
PVM, only at run-time. """

# In python there are a variety of runtime errors - Index error, Zerodivision error, Type error, etc.
# Examples to demonstrate the run-time errors

my_list = [1,2,3,4,5]
print(my_list[7]) # It gives an index-error detected only by PVM

my_num = 45
divisor = 0
print(my_num/divisor) # It gives a zerodivision error

# Run-time errors are sometimes un-avoidable in code so, we tend to use exception handling as an extra precaution.
